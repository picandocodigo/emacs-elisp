;;; Commentary:

;; This script converts acute vocals (á, é, í, ó, ú) and enye (ñ) into
;; their HTML equivalents(&aacute; etc.) for html documents.
;;
;; To install: put this file on the load-path and place the following
;; in your .emacs file:
;;
;;    (load "acute-to-html.el")
;;
;; To use: `M-x acute-to-html`
;;
;; I just wrote it to force me to learn some Elisp.
;;
;; TODO
;;  - More replacements (completely clean HTML maybe)
;;
